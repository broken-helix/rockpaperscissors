## **Future-Enhancements**

## **Testing Phase**

* Responsiveness - The page was tested for responsiveness on screen sizes throughout the development stages, using chrome dev tools, which allowed the page to be adjusted to display on small and large screen sizes.  The site was also tested using firefox on a desktop, on an android mobile phone using chrome, on an ipad and iphone 6 using safari and found to display correctly.
​
* Functionality - The links in the navigation have been selected individually to ensure they connect to the correct sections.  The form has been submitted without each input being completed to ensure that error messages are displayed, including entering email addresses without the '@' symbol.  The form has been submitted with correct entries to ensure that the Thank You page is displayed after submission.  The link returning users to the main page has been selected to make sure it is functioning correctly.

* Contrast - The contrast on the page was checked using the WCAG Color contrast checker plugin in chrome and found to pass the tests.
